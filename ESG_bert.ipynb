      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "\n",
      "We follow a defined process for conducting our impact analysis. In 2022 we conducted an impact analysis using UNEP-FI’s Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool for Banks (below). In 2023 we did not undertake a new \n",
      "analysis but reviewed the outputs from this tool against the output of our 2023 materiality assessment, disclosed in our GRI Index (here), to ensure this continues to be consistent with our understanding of what \n",
      "is significant to our business and our stakeholders. We also review the outputs against the business’s strategic priorities, as referenced in the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023. This helps us identify our areas of \n",
      "most significant positive and negative impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "STEP 2 – TARGET \n",
      "SETTING\n",
      "\n",
      "Barclays has previously identified ‘climate stability’ and ‘availability, accessibility, affordability, and quality of resources and services’ as our two significant impact areas. In 2023 we confirmed these two impact \n",
      "areas as the areas we will continue to focus on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate stability\n",
      "We are committed to aligning our financing with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement and we have set targets to reduce our financed emissions. Our approach to reducing our financed emissions is \n",
      "underpinned by our BlueTrack™ methodology.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a founding member of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), we have committed to setting science-based targets for material high-emitting sectors in our portfolio by April 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Availability, accessibility, affordability, and quality of resources and services\n",
      "Our sustainable financing is tracked using the methodologies set out in the Barclays Sustainable Finance Framework and the Transition Finance Framework. The Sustainable Finance Framework defines the \n",
      "criteria we use for social financing, environmental financing, green financing and sustainability-linked financing, while the Transition Finance Framework defines the criteria we use for transition financing, for the \n",
      "purpose of recording progress against our sustainable finance targets. A mapping of the financing criteria in our Sustainable Finance Framework with the impact topics which sit beneath the above-mentioned \n",
      "significant impact area showed a high degree of alignment. We have set a target to facilitate $1trn Sustainable and Transition Financing between 2023 and the end of 2030, in line with the Sustainable Finance \n",
      "Framework and the Transition Finance Framework. This target will also be used to track our performance against our second impact area. To bring additional granularity to this target, we publish an illustrative \n",
      "breakdown of our social and environmental financing against the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is done using the mappings in our Sustainable Finance Framework (below).\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2023 we are also reporting further targets in support of this impact area. These include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Through its Unreasonable Impact programme, Barclays has supported over 300 high-growth entrepreneurs with the network and resources they need to seek to address pressing social and environmental \n",
      "challenges. We aim to reach a further 200 ventures between 2023 and 2027. Through our Unreasonable Impact programme, Barclays is supporting high-growth entrepreneurs with the network and resources \n",
      "they need to address pressing social and environmental challenges. These ventures are driving innovations in a variety of industries, from energy and environment to food and water.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Through Barclays LifeSkills programme we aim to help 8.7 million young people develop the skills and confidence they need to succeed, and help 250,000 people get placed into work by 2027. \n",
